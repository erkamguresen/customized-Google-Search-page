# Welcome to My First Glitch Project

This is my first Glitch Project. _This project is prepared as a **Hack Your Future** technical assignment._

This website will be a customized google search webpage. 

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.
